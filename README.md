## CS321 - Software Engineering
*Milestone_5*<br>
*Group 2: Max Duchesne, Rosie Ingmann, Jonna Sosa, Isabella Feng, Dylan Tymkiw, Philipp Bogatyrev, Chloe Zhang*

### Abstract
In this assignment, we worked on developing a dynamic version of our Athletic Management System to the cloud.  Our Flask website was built on top of the previous milestone, and added new functional features from your backlog such as using real data, dynamically creating plots, changing some of the front end, and deploying your app to the cloud.  

### Sprint Backlog
High Priority
- Finish setting up permissions for each user
- Connect the create team page to the front end
- Create comments for our code
- Create an edit team page

Medium Priority
- Fix issue with the navigation bar on mobile
- Remodel peak and admin views such that both pages share the same aesthetic
- Create a download button that downloads a csv file with relevant athlete/team data
- Change the edit team page so that it updates dynamically
- Change the position of the download csv buttons

Low Priority
- Create an athlete search bar


### Results
In this milestone, we were able to further improve the functionality and appearance of our athlete management system. 
First of all, we remodeled the peak and admin views to look cleaner and more similar to the aesthetic of the other pages. 

We also created a page accessible from the admin view that allowed for editing teams (adding players, deleting players, and changing the coach). 

We also added the ability for users to download data in the form of csv files from the dashboard. For now, this was just the static hawkins and watch data but in the future this data will be specific to each player.

Finally, we added some small improvements like adding a create team button to connect that page to the front end, finalizing permissions for users, fine-tuning the navigation bar, and adding comments into our code.


### Contribution List
In this project, Dylan worked on finishing setting up the permissions for each user and creating and connecting a SQL server to the website. Max worked on the generate report functionality. Isabella worked on Flash notifications, nav bar error, code comments and burn-down chart. Jonna worked on the grind on the front end for both the PEAK and Admin pages, still working on being able to create users from a CSV files. Rosie worked on creating the edit teams page and functionality. Phil worked on the csv download functionality.

### Team Reflection
In this milestone, we learned a lot about deployment and SQL servers. Deploying the website with a SQL server was a challenge as Azure does not have very detailed instructions on how to do it. On top of that, we ran into a lot of problems when trying to import the necessary libraries in order to connect to the database. We also got a lot better at assigning issues and getting things done more efficiently.

### Extensions
1. Implement additional features from your backlog.
- We were able to access our website online, and since our visuals adjust its size automatically, our website still looks great when viewing from a device with a different proportion, such as a mobile phone. 
2. Burndown chart of your project. <br>
A burndown chart, one of the most common and useful Agile metrics, is created using Excel and is shown below. It demonstrates our daily efforts in comparison to the ideal burndown, as well as actual and planned hours working every day.

3. Write your report in Markdown as a readme file in your repository, including table images and appropriate tags and content. <br>
Done.
