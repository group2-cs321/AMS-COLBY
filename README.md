## CS321 - Software Engineering
*Milestone_3*<br>
*Group 2: Max Duchesne, Rosie Ingmann, Jonna Sosa, Isabella Feng, Dylan Tymkiw*

### Abstract
For this milestone, our objective was to create static web pages using HTML and CSS, as well as working collaboratively using Gitflow. We began by meeting as a group initially to outline different workstreams for the milestone, estimating the time it would take for each task and then dividing the tasks accordingly. We created a remote repository containing a main branch and a development branch; we then cloned the repository locally to work on our pages, then pushed our pages back into the remote repository. To consolidate all of our pages successfully, we needed to deal with various merge conflicts, which required a significant amount of time to resolve.  Overall, this milestone allowed us to improve our hard skills in HTML/CSS, Gitflow, as well as our soft skills in teamwork and collaboration.

### Results
Our main result from this milestone is our repository housing all of the static web pages. The repository can be accessed at https://github.com/tymkiwdylan/cs_321_milestone_3.io and the website is https://tymkiwdylan.github.io/. Below are screenshots and short descriptions of the web pages that we have created.<br>

![Login Page](/assets/report_images/login.png)
<p align="center"><b>Login page</b></p>
This is the initial page that the user will interact with to sign into the athlete management system. <br>

![Admin View](/assets/report_images/admin_view.png)
<p align="center"><b>Admin view</b></p>
This is the page that the admin will see and use to view data on various teams, generate reports, and edit user permissions.<br>

![Athlete view coach 2](/assets/report_images/a_coach2.png)
<p align="center"><b>Athlete view (coach)</b></p>
This is the page that the coach will have access to, providing them with visualizations for readiness, sleep, nutrition, and performance data.<br>
  
![Athlete view](/assets/report_images/a_view.png)
<p align="center"><b>Athlete view</b></p>
This is the page that the athlete will see, giving them an overview of their readiness, sleep, and nutritional trends and data.<br>

![PEAK view](/assets/report_images/p_view.png)
<p align="center"><b>PEAK view</b></p>
This is the page that PEAK team members will have access to, allowing them to view information on various teams, generate reports, and post notes for individual athletes.<br>

![Permissions page](/assets/report_images/p_page.png)
<p align="center"><b>Permission page</b></p>
This page will be accessible by the admin and will enable them to change permissions of individual users, create and delete users, and modify various data.<br>

![Restfulness page](/assets/report_images/r_page.png)
<p align="center"><b>Restfulness page</b></p>
This page provides users with a visual representation of the athlete’s current restfulness data in addition to their restfulness trends.<br>

![Sleep page](/assets/report_images/s_page.png)
<p align="center"><b>Sleep page</b></p>
This page provides users with a visual representation of the athlete’s current sleep data in addition to their sleep trends.<br>

### Contribution List
Dividing up the work was the most important, yet challenging aspect of this milestone. We got together after last week’s class and created issues that were then assigned to each member of the team. A good way to see who worked on what is by looking at the issues on our GitHub repository. The person that was responsible for most of the GitHub stuff was Dylan, he, in addition to creating the peak view, reviewed most pull requests and solved all the (annoying) merge conflicts, he also tried to be the main person when any git issues came up. Isabella developed the permission page and the login page, as well as setting up meeting times that helped keep the team in check. She also did Extension 2, 3, ane 4. Rosie worked on the coach dashboard, as well as most of the style that you can see across our pages. In the end, she was also the one to connect pages in a way that made sense. Jonna was the one in charge of developing everything related to athletes, that includes the athlete view and the view of every individual metric that an athlete can see. Max Duchesne developed the admin view which is the view that probably took the most effort to make. 

### Team Reflection
Developing new pages based on an html template was a lot of fun and we learned a lot. In order to figure out how to have nice graphs in our static website we even had to do some javascript which will definitely prove useful for later milestones. The most challenging aspect of this milestone was git, we had to spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to fix merge conflicts and how to set up git correctly in everyone’s computer. In the end, we all got significantly better at git, and this project definitely helped us grasp a much better understanding of how git workflow works and how it is useful when you make silly mistakes (i.e. the one time we deleted an entire html file).


### Extensions
1. Additional web page designs/elements that look and feel professional.
We have created pages for more specified metrics, such as restfulness page and sleep page, so users can see more detailed information.
2. Use additional GitHub features like projects and create a burndown chart of your project. 
We used GitHub Projects to keep track of our tasks (issues). For some reasons, the “generate chart” feature doesn’t work though.

3. Calculate Agile metrics for your team such as team velocity.
A burndown chart, one of the most common and useful Agile metrics, is created using Excel and is shown below. It demonstrates our daily efforts in comparison to the ideal burndown, as well as actual and planned hours working every day.

4. Write your report in Markdown as a readme file in your repository, including table images and appropriate tags and content.
Done.
5. Suggest your own creative extensions. 
With technology tools such as Zoom Meeting, frequent communication, and good time management, we managed to finish this milestone by working remotely with people in different cities and countries with different time zones (i.e. Jonna is in Mexico, Isabella was in Turkey, others are in the US).
